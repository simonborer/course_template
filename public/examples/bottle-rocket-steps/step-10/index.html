                        <p>Anthony goes into a bedroom. Looks in a dresser and takes out two watches. Digs through some socks and finds some cash.</p>
                        <p>Dignan goes in the study. Opens a drawer and closes it. Opens another and lifts out a set of thin leather coin books.</p>
