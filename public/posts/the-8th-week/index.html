<p style='margin-bottom: 2rem;'>Whether you&#39;re driven by ethics or the almighty dollar, great web performance is a must. Today we&#39;ll start learning how to deliver high-performance web applications, and the impact performance has on search engine optimization. We&#39;ll see how we can measure performance in the browser dev tools, and start by looking at the biggest opportunity for performance boosts: images.</p>

    <h2>Why optimize?</h2>
    <p>A website can be a lot of work. Why should we worry about making it "optimal", when it can just be "done"?</p>
</section>
<section>
    <img src="/images/overlap.svg" alt="" class="body-icon body-icon--white-bg slide-only" style="width: 180px;padding:2rem;border-radius: 1rem;margin-bottom: 0;">
    <p>Well, it turns out, if you're not making the time to prioritize your website's performance, it could have consequences for <strong>the planet</strong>, <strong>social disparities</strong>, and whether or not anyone uses your website in the first place!</p>
    <p>It's kind of nice that, more often than not, web optimization is one of those golden opportunities where what is "green", what is good, and what is profitable overlap.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <img src="/images/knight.svg" alt="" class="body-icon body-icon--white-bg slide-only" style="width: 180px;padding:2rem;border-radius: 1rem;margin-bottom: 0;">
    <p>That doesn't mean you won't have to fight for it sometimes - people tend to think of web optimization as one of those things that is responsible but boring, whereas weighing your site down with a bunch of videos, widgets, <a href="http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/" target="_blank">carousels<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, and other junk "looks neat" (even if the <strong>users hate it</strong>).</p>
</section>

<section id='the-web-s-carbon-footprint'><img class='body-icon' src='/images/ecology.svg'>
    <h2>The web's carbon footprint</h2>
    <p>Two years ago, Mozilla reported that the internet was producing <strong>more carbon emissions than <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-internet-uses-more-electricity-than/" target="_blank">the airline industry<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a></strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>I'm personally of the opinion that any solution that begins with, "If everybody would just..." is no solution at all.</p>
    <p>That's why it's important to keep pressure on big companies to do things like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54141899" target="_blank">wiping out their carbon footprint<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, but I also think it's important to consider the impact you might have if you end up working for (or starting!) a larger company that serves billions of megabytes to millions of people.</p>
    <p>While it would be very cool if everyone's websites were <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/power.html" target="_blank">solar powered<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, the simplest and most accessible way to reduce your website's carbon footprint is by making it smaller.</p>
</section>

    <img src="/images/scale.svg" alt="" class="body-icon body-icon--white-bg slide-only" style="width: 180px;padding:2rem;border-radius: 1rem;margin-bottom: 0;">
    <p>When I say "smaller", I don't mean a smaller font-size, or even less content, I mean in terms of "page weight" - <strong>smaller file sizes for your code and assets</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Democratizing through performance</h2>
    <p>In low- and middle-income countries, every 10% increase in broadband internet access <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/broadband_commission_report_overview.pdf" target="_blank">increases both GDP and overall employment by about 1.4%<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>

    <img src="/images/video.svg" alt="" class="body-icon slide-only" style="height: 50px;padding:2rem;border-radius: 1rem;margin-bottom: 0;">
    <p>It's not the cabling that makes the difference - it's the access. A few years back, the Youtube team set a "performance budget" (a maximum page weight), squeezed every ounce of savings from their code and launched - only to find their average loading times had skyrocketed!</p>
    <p>When they looked at the analytics, they realized that millions of people in places with poor internet connectivity had suddenly gained the ability to watch Youtube. Prior to optimization, <strong>the videos would simply "time out" because the site was too slow</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <img src="/images/world.svg" alt="" class="body-icon">
    <p>Making your site accessible to people with slow internet connections, underpowered devices, or sketchy mobile networks means granting access to potentially millions of people. Depending on what your site is and does, this could mean granting economic and learning opportunities that weren't there before, or it could just mean a good customer experience.</p>

    <h3 class='text-center'>Factors in SEO</h3>
    <p>Search engines keep their precise algorithms secret in order to discourage "<strong>dark patterns</strong>" - people trying to game the system.</p>
    <p>That being said, the search engine companies are open about what factors they take into consideration when deciding what the best search results are.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>We've already talked about how to achieve some of the most important metrics - we've looked at how to make our site <a href="/posts/the-2nd-week/#semantics">semantic</a>, <a href="/posts/the-2nd-week/#accessibility" target="_blank">accessible</a>, <a href="/posts/the-5th-week/#mobile" target="_blank">mobile-friendly and responsive</a>, and how to curate content that <a href="/posts/the-7th-week/#content" target="_blank">capitalizes on search trends</a>.</p>
    <p>Next week, we'll discuss two other factors: how to <strong>secure your site</strong> and deliver your site over HTTPS using an SSL certificate, and how to <strong>organize your URL structure</strong> in an SEO-friendly way.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>There are three other significant factors in SEO:</p>

    <h2>Image types</h2>
    <p>For the typical website, images are probably the asset that takes up the most bandwidth. Therefore, the choices you make with your images could make or break your performance.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <img src="/images/edit.svg" alt="" class="body-icon slide-only">
    <p>Images come in different <strong>formats</strong>. You've probably already noticed that image files can have different file extensions. Each format has some <strong>things they're good at</strong>, and some <strong>things they're not so good at</strong>. It depends what it's an image of, and what you want to use it for!</p>

    <p>Everybody loves rich, full-colour photographic images.</p>
    <p>This is where the <strong>JPEG</strong> format shines. It uses "lossy compression" to deliver reasonably lightweight images that look good (even if some amount of detail is lost).</p>
    <p>Images in JPEG format are saved with the file extension <strong>.jpg</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p class="callout primary">Alternatively, there is a new images format that does well with photographic detail at an even small size. This image format is called <strong>WEBP</strong>. The drawbacks of webp are that it <strong>isn't supported in older browsers</strong>, or by <strong>most image-viewing software</strong> outside the browser, and <strong>converting to webp can be challenging</strong>.</p>

    <p>You should be able to use the Adobe Suite via <a href="https://its.humber.ca/services/services-students/academic-application-streaming-service" target="_blank">Humber's appsteam service<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>. Otherwise, <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> is a free, open-source alternative.</p>
    <p>But the functionality we need is pretty simple compared to what those photo editing suites offer. If you don't already have a photo editor you like installed on your computer, Adobe has a free online editor called <a href="https://photoshop.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Photoshop Express<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> that does everything we need for our purposes, including resizing images and compressing them.</p>
    <p>So <strong>consider the largest your image will need to be</strong> - if you're going to use it to fill the width of your main column, and your main column is 960px wide, your image should be 960px in width!</p>

<div class="callout primary">
    <h4 style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Further reading</h4>Want to serve different images based on viewport width or pixel density (i.e. retina devices)? That's a great idea, and totally possible thanks to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture" target="_blank"><code class="language-html">&lt;picture&gt;</code> element<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>. However, it's a deep-dive that we don't have time for today.

    <h3 class="text-center">The amount of compression</h3>
    <p>Balancing image resolution with file size isn't an exact science. For one thing, <strong>it depends on the image</strong>!</p>
    <p>If it's a well-lit photograph of primary-coloured blocks, that's going to <strong>compress really nicely</strong>. Gradients, on the other hand, don't tend to fare so well, as they're the first thing you notice once the <strong>number of colours starts to drop</strong> from many millions to hundreds of thousands to hundreds.</p>

    <figcaption>This 800px-wide image, saved at different "quality" levels from Photoshop express: 100, 80, 60, 30, 15 and 1.</figcaption>

    </figure>

<section>
    <p>Notice that there is a <strong>huge saving on the file size</strong> between Level 100 and Level 80, with <strong>diminishing returns</strong> the further down you go. Judge for yourself when you start caring about the loss in image quality. For me it's > Level 30, but &lt; Level 80.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size:1.25rem;">Going further</h4>
        <p>You can actually get a lot more savings with tools beyond just exporting from your image editor, but most of these tools are command-line based and/or should be built into your development workflow.</p><img style="float:left;margin:0 1rem 0 0;" src="/images/tinypng.jpg" alt="">
    <p>That being said, I've struggled to get better results than those offered by a free, drag-and-drop website called <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank">TinyPNG<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, which, despite the name, works for both PNG and JPEG formats.</p>
    <p>It does a really remarkable job, and I use it often for small projects!</p>

    <h2>Background images</h2>
    <p>Remember how I mentioned earlier that you would <strong>never put relevant text content in an image</strong>?</p>
    <p>There's a good reason for that! <strong>Computers suck at reading text embedded in images</strong>, and Google doesn't try. If your text content matters, it shouldn't be hidden away in an image, or an alt attribute. That would be <strong>very bad for both accessibility and SEO</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3 class="text-center">But what if I want text on top of an image??</h3>
    <p>If you're going to overlay text on an image <em>that conveys information</em>, you're going to have to use the CSS positioning & layering techniques <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/the-5th-week/#position">we talked about in week 5</a> in order to move your text on top of your image.</p>
    <p>However, if your image <strong>conveys no information</strong>, then we can use the CSS property <code class="language-css">background-image</code>. The reason I make this distinction is because <strong>background images are not accessible</strong> - you <strong>can't put an alt attribute</strong> on them to supply a text alternative.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3 class="text-center">CSS background properties</h3>
    <p>You're already familiar with the CSS "background" property, but there are several more properties that affect the background of a block element.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <pre><code class="language-css">.my-class {
    background: blue;
    background-image: url('/images/my-image.jpg');
}</code></pre>
    <p>The "background-image" property accepts a url pointing to a an image file. Notice that the file path is wrapped in the <code>url()</code> function - it won't work without that.</p>
    <p>Luckily, if you forgot it, or if the link to the image was broken, or if the image was in a format that the browser didn't support, the elements with your class would still get the background color you defined.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p class="callout primary">One of the very cool things about CSS is that if you have an invalid or unsupported property, it doesn't throw an error - it just <strong>ignores it and moves on to the next thing</strong>. This means it's really easy to create fallbacks like this!</p><p>Go ahead, use that fancy new property that only works in one browser - when it doesn't work, you've got a backup declared.</p><p>This is also known as "<strong>progressive enhancement</strong>" - letting cool new features fail silently in places that they aren't supported, with reliable backups in place.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>You can also set the <code>background-size</code>, <code>background-position</code>, and <code>background-repeat</code> properties.</p>
    <p>Use these for all your poetry backdrops!</p>

        <li>Put together the <strong>copy deck</strong> & <strong>image assets</strong> for a <strong>simple</strong> three page website. This can be anything you like, and doesn't require in-page navigation, multiple sections, or any of the other requirements from previous assignments. That being said, if you want to re-use code you wrote before, go for it!<br><em>Note: you don't have to code anything this week, but you will next week, because we're gonna put these pages online, so let me repeat: <strong>keep it simple</strong></em>.</li>
        <li>For your copy deck, plaintext, rtf, Word or Google Docs are all acceptable formats.
        <li>The copy deck should not only include the literal text of your pages, but also note what content will be headings, what content will be linked, and any other UI elements that may be on your page.</li>
        <li>These pages will need to link to one another, so you can get to any of the other two pages from any of the three pages.</li>
        <li>On at least one page, give your content a <strong>good reason</strong> to have a JPEG image.</li>
        <li>On at least one page, give your content a <strong>good reason</strong> to have a PNG image.</li>
        <li>On at least one page, give your content a <strong>good reason</strong> to have a background image.</li>
